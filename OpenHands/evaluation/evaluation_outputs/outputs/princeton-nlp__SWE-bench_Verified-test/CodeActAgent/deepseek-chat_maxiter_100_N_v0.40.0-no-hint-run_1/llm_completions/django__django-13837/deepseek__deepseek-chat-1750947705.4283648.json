You should be thorough, methodical, and prioritize quality over speed.\n* If the user asks a question, like \"why is X happening\", don't try to fix the problem. Just give an answer to the question.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases.

If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The bash command to execute. Can be empty string to view additional logs when previous exit code is `-1`. Can be `C-c` (Ctrl+C) to interrupt the currently running process. Note: You can only execute one bash command at a time. If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, you can use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n  (2) is_input (string, optional): If True, the command is an input to the running process. If False, the command is a bash command to be executed in the terminal. Default is False.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`]\n  (3) timeout (number, optional): Optional. Sets a hard timeout in seconds for the command execution. If not provided, the command will use the default soft timeout behavior.\n---- END FUNCTION #1 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #2: think ----\nDescription: Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or make any changes to the repository, but just log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.\n\nCommon use cases:\n1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.\n2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.\n3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different approaches and their tradeoffs.\n4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture decisions and implementation details.\n5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts and hypotheses.\n\nThe tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does not execute any code or make changes.\nParameters:\n  (1) thought (string, required): The thought to log.\n---- END FUNCTION #2 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #3: finish ----\nDescription: Signals the completion of the current task or conversation.\n\nUse this tool when:\n- You have successfully completed the user's requested task\n- You cannot proceed further due to technical limitations or missing information\n\nThe message should include:\n- A clear summary of actions taken and their results\n- Any next steps for the user\n- Explanation if you're unable to complete the task\n- Any follow-up questions if more information is needed\n\nThe task_completed field should be set to True if you believed you have completed the task, and False otherwise.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) message (string, required): Final message to send to the user\n  (2) task_completed (string, required): Whether you have completed the task.\nAllowed values: [`true`, `false`, `partial`]\n---- END FUNCTION #3 ----\n\n---- BEGIN FUNCTION #4: str_replace_editor ----\nDescription: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files in plain-text format\n* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\nParameters:\n  (1) command (string, required): The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.\nAllowed values: [`view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`]\n  (2) path (string, required): Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/workspace/file.py` or `/workspace`.\n  (3) file_text (string, optional): Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.\n  (4) old_str (string, optional): Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.\n  (5) new_str (string, optional): Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.\n  (6) insert_line (integer, optional): Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\n  (7) view_range (array, optional): Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\n---- END FUNCTION #4 ----\n\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- You may provide optional reasoning for your function call in natural language BEFORE the function call, but NOT after.\n- If there is no function call available, answer the question like normal with your current knowledge and do not tell the user about function calls\n</IMPORTANT>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Here's a running example of how to perform a task with the provided tools.\n\n--------------------- START OF EXAMPLE ---------------------\n\nUSER: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, and display them in a web page at port 5000.\n\n\nASSISTANT: Sure!

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/django__django__3.2 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 415f50298f97fb17f841a9df38d995ccf347dfcc.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.\n\n--------------------- END OF NEW TASK DESCRIPTION ---------------------\n\nPLEASE follow the format strictly!

The current implementation relies on checking `__file__` which isn't always available.\n\nKey points:\n1. Problem location: `django.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments`\n2. Current behavior: Only works with `python -m django`\n3. Desired behavior: Should work with `python -m any_package`\n4. Solution approach: Use `__main__.__spec__` properties which are more reliable:\n   - `__main__.__spec__ is not None` indicates -m was used\n   - `__main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\"` identifies the specific package\n5. Benefits:\n   - More reliable across Python environments\n   - Enables Django-based CLI utilities with custom __main__ modules\n   - Removes dependency on __file__\n\nBest practices to consider:\n1.

Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* If asked to edit a file, edit the file directly, rather than creating a new file with a different filename.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* When configuring git credentials, use \"openhands\" as the user.name and \"openhands@all-hands.dev\" as the user.email by default, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n1. EXPLORATION: Thoroughly explore relevant files and understand the context before proposing solutions\n2. ANALYSIS: Consider multiple approaches and select the most promising one\n3. TESTING:\n   * For bug fixes: Create tests to verify issues before implementing fixes\n   * For new features: Consider test-driven development when appropriate\n   * If the repository lacks testing infrastructure and implementing tests would require extensive setup, consult with the user before investing time in building testing infrastructure\n   * If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to install all dependencies\n4. IMPLEMENTATION: Make focused, minimal changes to address the problem\n5. VERIFICATION: If the environment is set up to run tests, test your implementation thoroughly, including edge cases. If the environment is not set up to run tests, consult with the user first before investing time to run tests.\n</PROBLEM_SOLVING_WORKFLOW>\n\n<SECURITY>\n* Only use GITHUB_TOKEN and other credentials in ways the user has explicitly requested and would expect.\n* Use APIs to work with GitHub or other platforms, unless the user asks otherwise or your task requires browsing.\n</SECURITY>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* When user asks you to run an application, don't stop if the application is not installed. Instead, please install the application and run the command again.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. Step back and reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem\n  2. Assess the likelihood of each possible cause\n  3. Methodically address the most likely causes, starting with the highest probability\n  4. Document your reasoning process\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan and confirm with the user before proceeding.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>", "role": "system"}, {"content": "\n<uploaded_files>\n/workspace/django__django__3.2\n</uploaded_files>\n\nI've uploaded a python code repository in the directory django__django__3.2. Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\nAllow autoreloading of `python -m pkg_other_than_django runserver`\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by William Schwartz)\n\t \n\u200bdjango.utils.autoreload.get_child_arguments detects if Python was launched as python -m django. Currently it detects only when \u200b-m was passed specifically django (and only in Python environments in which __file__ is set on modules, which is \u200bnot true of all Python environments). Like #32177, this ticket aims to remove one impediment to creating Django-based command-line utilities that have their own \u200b__main__ sub-module while overriding Django's built-in management commands\u2014in this case, runserver.\nThe fix, which I have submitted in the \u200battached PR, is to use Python's \u200bdocumented way of determining if -m was used in get_child_arguments:\nThe top-level __main__ module is always the entry point of a \u200bcomplete Python program.\n __main__.__spec__ is not None \u200bif and only if Python was launched with -m or the name of a \"directory, zipfile or other sys.path entry.\" In the latter cases, the \u200bdocumentation says\nIf the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of sys.path and the __main__.py file in that location is executed as the __main__ module.\nHence __main__.__spec__.parent (which is \u200busually but not always __main__.__package__) exists and is the empty string when Python is started with the name of a directory or zip file.\nTherefore Python was started with -m pkg if and only if __main__.__spec__.parent == \"pkg\".\nFollowing this algorithm is guaranteed to work as long as Python obeys its own documentation, and has the side benefit of avoiding use of __file__.\n\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/django__django__3.2 directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 415f50298f97fb17f841a9df38d995ccf347dfcc.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Let me begin with Phase 1: READING and understanding the issue.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"id": "toolu_01", "type": "function", "function": {"name": "think", "arguments": "{\"thought\": \"\\nThe issue describes a limitation in Django's autoreload functionality where it only detects Python launched with `-m django` but not other packages.
